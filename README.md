I'm Ahhj (Alistair IRL, he/him)

- By day I'm a Data Scientist @ NHS Digital ðŸ©º 
- In my spare time, I'm a novice ReactJS developer
- But professionally, I code in Python and PySpark (you're way better off asking me about those!)
- I'm keen to collaborate on any coding/data science for good projects
- Most importantly, I don't usually have a moustache
