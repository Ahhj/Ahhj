I'm Alistair (he/him)

- By day I'm a Data Scientist @ NHS Digital 🩺 
- In my spare time, I'm a novice ReactJS developer 💻
- But professionally, I code in Python 🐍 and PySpark ✨ (so you're way better off asking me about those!)
- I'm keen to collaborate on any coding/data science for good projects 🙏
- I don't usually have a moustache 👨🏼
